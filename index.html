        <p class="p1">I engage and love drawing 2 dimensional arts, I spend a lot of time either observing or sketching objects,people or scenery that I find Fascinating</p>
        <p class="p2">I've always loved the idea of drawing my favorite fictional characters since I was a kid,but I never thought of Art as a profession because of the way Artists in my country turn out. But recently I decided to learn art more seriously and it has been an awesome experience.</p>
